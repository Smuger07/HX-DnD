As the wagon wheels into Phandalin in the early afternoon, the group arrive at a small inn in town called Stone Hill Inn.
Sildar, still bruised and battered by his encounter with the goblins in the cave, thanks the group for saving him and liberating the cave to prevent other traders being ambushed on the treacherous road from Neverwinter.
Before Sildar turns in for the evening, he highlights the path to drop off Gundrens wagon and wares to Bartons provinces, just down the road.
Stealing the remaining light in the day, they ride the wagon through the newly formed town still in transition from an outpost, towards Bartons provinces, the main trading post in Phandalin.
Retrieving their payment from Elamr, the owner of the trading post, the group carry the crates looted from the goblin cave, who are owned by Lionshield Coster.
Lionshield Coster, a smaller shop that has been struggling over the past few months by a mixture of bandits and hooligans in town, orcs and goblins ambushing trade routes to and from town.
The owner, Lenine, is surprised by the delivery of her stolen crates offers the group a reward in gratitude before closing the shops doors for the evening.

Night falls as the party splits in the middle of town, Buffey heading to the nearby temple dedicated to Olladra, goddess of good fortune, while the rest of the party heads back to Stone Hill Inn.
At the temple, Buffey enquires about one of the temple followers that was attacked recently.
Sister Grail, retells the story of her confrontation with a banshee outside of town that attacked her while she was following news of powerful magic nearby.
Back at the inn, the group rent rooms from the inn owner and discuss about the bandits in the town.
The owner, Toblerone, warns the group about the bandits and their favored drinking hole the Sleeping Giant, which most people stay clear from.
Discussing round a table of ale, Toblerone and his wife share warnings of the bandits kidnapping the woodcutter and his family.
Rumour say they murdered them shortly afterwards, but due to how relatively new of a town Pahndelin is, no guards are on the case to deal with the bandits.
Being sufficiently merry at this point, the group retire for the night.

As the next day arises, the group reconvene with Buffy at the town hall as they share how they all spent the evening.
Awaiting them at the town hall, Sildar thanks them again for saving him and as promised, gives them the gold pieces he promised for saving him and clearing the goblin cave.
Still concerned about his business partner, he asks the crew to follow on the trail for Gundren and "The Black Spider", with only an unknown location of "Cragmoore Castle" as the next clue.
Although Sildar has no information on the castle, his mentor and captain of the Lords Alliance, Larno, might be able to point them in the right direction.
However, nobody has heard from him since he went to the abandoned mansion on the outskirts of town.
Before following on the only lead they have, the crew consult with the Town Mayor, Harbin, about the bandits in town and a reward posting for some orcs nearby Wyvern Tor.

Deciding to follow on the trail for the MIA Larno, the group head to the abandoned mansion in town who quickly were greeted by a small group of cultists/bandits, which the group greeted in kind by eliminating 2 while the other disappeared through a hidden door.
Stealing some of their costumes as a disguise, they delve deeper into the mansion via the hidden door.
Negotiating with a squatting Nothic to leave them in peace, they accidentally stumble into the leader of the cult, Glasstaff, who is none other than Larno himself.
Rudolph and Oscar, stumbling over their words successfully managed to persuade Glasstaff that they were "new recruits on their meet the team".
Fin noticing the train wreak that is about to speed into the station steps in casting Tasha's hideous laughter, pacifying Glasstaff.

Glasstaff tied up during his laughing fit, spills the beans about his involvement with ambushing and kidnapping Gundren to gain possession of some dwarven maps to the cave of wonders, for his boss "The Black Spider".
Shoving him into his bedside chest (after poking some air holes), the group set off to navigate the rest of the mansion stronghold in persuit of some goblins that may provide more information towards Cragmoore Castle
