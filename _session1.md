Oscar, Rudolph, Buffey, Fin, Percy and Spooge were gathering in a run down pub in neverwinter.
Previous jobs haven’t been so fortunate for the group so times were tough.
With just enough to get by with some food and ale, the group were approached by Oscar’s cousin, Gundren Rockseeker.
Gundren was a stout dwarf with short ginger beard linking to his long beard, who the group have ran into in previous endeavours.
With his mysterious human bodyguard, Sildar Hallwinter, by his side, the pair negotiated with the group to assist in transporting some mining supplies to the town of Phandalin along the sword coast.
After bartering the reward, the group decided to assist their dwarven friend and set off in the early hours of the morning.

On the morning of the departure from Neverwinter, the gang met their wagon driver, Dee, who would help escort them and the supplies to Phandalin.
A couple of hours into the ride, they abruptly stopped at the sign of foul play, as Dee and Oscar at the front of the wagon spotted dead horses in the middle of the road.
Being the fearless adventurer he is, Fin the bard approached the horses to see what was going on.
Strumming his lute as he got closer, he noticed the bags the horses were carrying shared the same insignia of Gundren.
Suddenly the group were ambushed (well, “ambush” being they fell out the nearby trees) by some goblins.
After swiftly being dispatched by the group, the left the last goblin alive for interrogation.
After some good cop/bad cop by Fin and Spooge, the goblin only provided his leader’s name, Clarg.
Following a trail Percy discovered of what seems to be tracks, they followed them leading to a cave.

After some more encounters with goblins, the group were heading in the right direction as they entered the cave entrance.
As they delved deeper, they stumbled across a group of goblins guarding a prisoner.
Quickly dispatching the grunts of the group, their leader along with the hostage tried to negotiate with the group to avoid further deaths (mainly himself).
As Rudolph said he could “make the shot” with his longbow (a feat the rest of the party doubted, given his previous archery attacks), the goblin leader panicked, throwing the hostage off a ledge and rushed the group.
Cleaving the leader entwine, Rudolph stabilized the prisoner, who was none other than Sildar Hallwinter.
After explaining the true purpose of their mission of finding the lost cave of phandalin, a cave of wonders filled with magical items and riches that was lost to time, Sildar mentioned they were being followed by “The Black Spider”.
Before following on this trail, the group went after the remaining goblins in the cave and their leader Clarg, a large bugbear.
After an intense fight (which Percy was knocked prone for most/all of it due to “trying to look cool” with his acrobatic attacks), Clarg and the remaining goblins were vanquished.
Retrieving some loot, the group pressed forward towards Phandalin in search for Gundren and the mysterious cave of wonders...
